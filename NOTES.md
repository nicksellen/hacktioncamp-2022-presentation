top mistakes from pitch decks (https://www.toptal.com/finance/pitch-deck-consultants/pitch-deck-best-practices)
anticipate questions/feedback
realistic projections
tell a story --> "A problem well stated is a problem half-solved", pitch the problem!
do your homework!
make it look professional (or "community" for this case...)

As Albert Einstein famously said, “If I had an hour to solve a problem I’d spend 55 minutes thinking about the problem and five minutes thinking about solutions.

traction! (how fediverse is already doing well...)

"What’s clear is that salvation lies in working together – in throwing our weight not behind organisations, but behind each other. "

what is the problem I want to solve?
two problems:
1. siloed spaces, disconnected people
  - living on some kind of auto pilotA
  - siloed atomised lives, professional roles, disconnected from natural
  - disconnected from the wider web of life, natural, other...
  - many projects and networks, focused on the goals of the projects, tend towards project-centred, work-like environments with social bolted around the edges
  - online lives, but disconnected from local life
  - missing casual space for ad-hoc sharing 
  - social media exists but...
2. corporate social media is a toxic shithole

  "On the surface, social media exists to keep human beings connected. But at its core, its business model relies on surveilling, analyzing, and manipulating your behavior in order to more effectively sell you things. It also deprives you of your economic dignity, hampers the democratic process, and even undermines your experience of humanity."
  "I don’t think social media in some broad sense is necessarily bad,” says Jaron. “I don’t think it has to be bad forever. I think that there’s this business model that makes it bad…it’s been taken over by this advertising paradigm. And what that means is any time two people connect, it’s financed by some third person who wants to manipulate those people — because that’s the only way anyone makes money — the whole system becomes optimized for addiction, manipulation, sneakiness, and trickiness.

“And once it’s optimized for that, then it’s really easy for bad actors to create millions of fake people to create fake social perception to create…fake news, fake paranoias and irritabilities to get people distracted or shut down. It’s a very common strategy. The whole thing has turned into garbage.”"
  - advertising
  - algorithms (confusing, pushing content on you)
  - celebs, attention seeking, controversial, heat, outrage
    - activates intense emotions for engagement
  - the liberatory vision of the internet is slipping away
  - scale is too big, 
  "So, I think decency in society in a sense of high standards, in a sense of commitment, come from intermediate-scale organizations like, you know, churches, universities, guilds, unions, corporations with ethical standards. All kinds of structures. It’s these in-between structures that people join voluntarily where you can talk about excellence and talk about standards. You can’t really do that globally or it turns into authoritarianism."

solution:
- a local-focused social media platform, microblogging style, for casual sharing of thoughts/content/links/events/food/cat pics, etc... 
- tap into fediverse ecosystem, paradigm and software already exists!
  - already 4 million users, home to all sorts of outcasts from corporate social media, taking the power back!
- owned by the users, we can all have a say in how it should work, get better practised at democratic organising
- useful for individuals or projects to connect
- somewhat an experiment... 
- eventually funded by optional donations to cover basic costs (human + tech)
- democratic

why now?
- increasing awareness of problems of corporate social media
- increasing need for reconnecting our society
- waiting to be saved is depressing...
- we can do this stuff ourselves!

alternatives:
- projects of liberation
  - create a space for action, but often siloed... and drift towards work-like productivity
- whatsapp groups
  - closed, can't filter who you want to follow
  - daunting to write into a big channel, nowhere to share your personal content
  - corporate/privacy facebook ownership issues bother some people
- facebook
  - facebook is trying to stuff all sorts of content in your face
  - not a good look in 2021, used out of neccessity...?
- others? what did I not find?

strategy:
- get pilot up and running, early january, people can sign up
- share with select local groups/networks/people that we know, early adopters
- if it seems a go-er, structure a bit more, clarifying roles...
- do an Official Launch with a nice story, local press, ... wider networks/people.. open for all!

what do we need right now?:
- I'd like another tech/tech-curious person
- a minimal terms of service document
- a story and a bit of text to share with early adopters
- a logo to get us started?
- 

A community owned online town square for Bath?
A co-operatively owned social media platform for Bath and it's surrounding area?

...?


bowie quote:

"What the internet is going to do to society, both good and bad, is unimaginable."

“I don’t think we’ve even seen the tip of the iceberg...I think we’re actually on the cusp of something exhilarating and terrifying.”

See more: A highly skeptical Paxman then says, “It’s just a tool though isn’t it?”

“No. It’s an alien life form [laughing], is there life on Mars? Yes, it’s just landed here," replies Bowie.

"The actual context and state of content is going to be so different to anything we envisage at the moment.

"Where the interplay between the user and the provider will be so in simpatico it’s going to crush our ideas of what mediums are all about.

"It’s happening in every form. That grey space in the middle is what the 21st century is going to be about.”

"The idea that the piece of work is not finished until the audience comes to it and adds their new interpretation and what the piece of art is about is the gray space in the middle, That grey space in the middle is what the 21st century is going to be about."

It's happening in visual art.
